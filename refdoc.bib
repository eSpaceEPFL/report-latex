abstract = {The procedure is the principal mechanism employed by the end‐user to control the space system during pre‐launch functional testing and post‐launch in‐orbit operations. This Standard identifies the requirements to be satisfied by any language used for the development of automated test and operation procedures. It also defines a reference language that fulfils these requirements. This language is called the “procedure language for users in test and operations (PLUTO)”.},

@techreport{ECSS-E-ST-10C,
abstract = {This standard specifies the systems engineering implementation requirements for space systems and space products development. Specific objectives of this standard are: {\textperiodcentered} to implement the system engineering requirements to ensure a firm technical basis and to minimize technical risk and cost for space systems and space products development; {\textperiodcentered} to specify the essential system engineering tasks, their objectives and outputs; {\textperiodcentered} to implement integration and control of engineering disciplines and lower level systems engineering work; {\textperiodcentered} to implement the “customer–system–supplier model” through the development of systems and products for space applications. This Standard is intended to apply to all space systems and product, at any level of the system decomposition, including hardware, software, procedures, man-in-the-loop, facilities and services. Through the document and its annexes the requirements however apply as they are to complex systems only; for lower level elements tailoring will be necessary. Specific requirements related to systems engineering, like functional analysis, technical specification, verification, and testing are specified in dedicated documents and standards within the set of ECSS system engineering standards ECSS-E-10-XX.},

abstract = {Ground systems and operations are key elements of a space system and as such play an essential role in achievingmission success. Mission success is definedhere as the achievement of the target mission objectives as expressed in terms of the quantity, quality and availability of delivered mission products and serviceswith- in a given cost envelope. Mission success requires successful completion of a long and complex process covering the definition, design, implementation, validation, in flight operations and post operational activities, involving both the ground segment and also space segment elements. It involves technical activities, aswell as human and financial resources, and encompasses the full range of space engineering disciplines.More- over it necessitates a close link with the design of the space segment in order to ensure proper compatibility between both elements of the complete space system.},
